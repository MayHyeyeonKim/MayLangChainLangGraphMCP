**Questions** 
 Which pitcher is better for latte art? Mine has a rounded spout, but should the spout be sharper?

**Answer** 
 When choosing a pitcher for latte art, the spout design is an important factor to consider. A sharper or more tapered spout generally provides better control over the milk flow, which is essential for creating detailed and intricate patterns. This is because a sharper spout allows you to more precisely control the stream of milk, making it easier to draw fine lines and complex designs.

While rounded spouts can be used for latte art, they are often better suited for simpler designs, as they don't provide the same level of control. If your goal is to improve your latte art skills and create more intricate patterns, you might want to try a pitcher with a sharper spout.

Additionally, other factors such as the size and shape of the pitcher, the handle, and your personal comfort with it also play roles in your success with latte art. Many baristas find that experimenting with different pitchers helps them find the one that best suits their style and technique.
